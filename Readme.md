# Blender Generator

This is a learning project which aims to create procedural mesh that will be rendered in Blender.

## Features

### Procedural meshes

This project allows to create a torus mesh based on its formula and to render it 
thanks to Blender :

### Marching cubes

The marching cubes algorithm is used to created mesh from sdf functions such as the 3D Mandelbrot
set.

__Results__:

Here are some outputs of Mandelbulb:
